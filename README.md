# 100_days_of_computer_vision

This repository contains the codes for **100 days of computer vision** challenge. I pursue this challenge with a focus on concepts of 3D & 2D Computer vision (and thus, some concepts in computer graphics). The challenge is inspired by the [100 Days of Code](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) challenge. 

## Covered Topics
- [x] Day 1: Render a textured mesh using PyTorch3D
  
  In this notebook (located in `Pytorch3D/notebooks/render_textured.ipynb`) I followed tutorials on [this link](https://pytorch3d.org/tutorials/) to render, visualize and modify a textured mesh using PyTorch3D.

- [x] Day 2: Render a dense pose using PyTorch3D
  
  In this notebook (located in `Pytorch3D/notebooks/render_dense_pose.ipynb`) I followed tutorials on [this link](https://pytorch3d.org/tutorials/) to render, visualize and modify a dense human pose using PyTorch3D. We used SMPL model for this sake.

- [x] Day 3: Deform a base mesh and optimize to get to the target mesh

  In this notebook (located in `Pytorch3D/notebooks/deform_to_fit.ipynb`) I followed tutorials on [this link](https://pytorch3d.org/tutorials/) to deform a base mesh (simply, a sphere) and deform vertices in an optimization process to reach to the target mesh.
