# 100_days_of_computer_vision

This repository contains the codes for **100 days of computer vision** challenge. I pursue this challenge with a focus on concepts of 3D & 2D Computer vision (and thus, some concepts in computer graphics). The challenge is inspired by the [100 Days of Code](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) challenge. 

## Covered Topics
1. PyTorch3D:
   
   Please refer to [this readme file](Pytorch3D/README.md) for in-depth information on the implemented projects with PyTorch3D. The covered projects are:

   [Rendering a textured mesh](Pytorch3D/notebooks/render_textured.ipynb) / [Rendering a dense pose](Pytorch3D/notebooks/render_dense_pose.ipynb) / [Deforming a base mesh and optimizing to get to the target mesh](Pytorch3D/notebooks/deform_to_fit.ipynb)

2. From Scratch Projects:
  
    Please refer to [this readme file](FromScratch/README.md) for in-depth information on the implemented projects from scratch. The covered projects are:

    [Image Formation](FromScratch/Image_Formation/main.py) / ...
