# From Scratch Projects
In these projects, I implemented some of famous algorithms used in Computer Vision and 3D Computer vision from scratch. These are obviously for educational purposes and for understanding how things work under the hood.

## Image Formation
Here, you can see a simple implementation of how an image is formed in a camera (pinhole camera model). The code is written in Python and uses Plotly for visualization. You can find the code in the `Image_Formation` directory. Use the following command to run the code:
```bash
pip install plotly numpy scipy
python main.py
```

The result will look like this:

![Image Formation 2D Plot](../Images/formation_2d.png)
